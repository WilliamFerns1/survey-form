A simple newsletter form, made with HTML and CSS, for Automa Automations. Feel free to check <a href="https://survey-form-self.vercel.app/" target="_blank">the survey form</a> out, and give feedback on what I can improve if you like.  

## Technologies:
1. HTML
2. CSS

## Project Motive:
I am collaborating with my brother on <a href="https://github.com/Automa-Automations/" target="_blank">Automa Automations</a>, a social media content automation SaaS, leveraging AI. I figured making a simple newsletter form I might use later on would be a great idea.

## Contributions:
If you really like the newsletter form, and you see something you can improve, feel free to **fork** this repo, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you see any spelling mistake on this markdown file, or on the website, please make an **issue**, so that I can fix it. Thanks. Recommendations on how I can improve it would be great.

## What I learnt from making this project:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Mobile Responsiveness
